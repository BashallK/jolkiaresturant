<h1>Basic Mashed Potatoes</h1>
<h3>How to Make Mashed Potatoes</h3>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p1>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered<br>

3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (Optional)<br>

1 cup milk<br>

2 tablespoons butter<br>

salt and ground black pepper to taste</p1> 
<p>
Bring a very very huge pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.<br>

When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.<br>

Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.<br>
